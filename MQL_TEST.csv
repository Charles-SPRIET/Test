I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out on behalf of Agilery, a general contractor. We have an exciting opportunity that we believe aligns with your expertise and capabilities, and we are interested in exploring the potential of a collaboration.
One of our clients produces microalgae-based products using their innovative biomass fermenters in Israel. They are now actively seeking to expand their production capacity to meet the growing product demand. They are searching for a reliable and capable co-manufacturer to install and run their fermenters to achieve this.
Here are the key details of the project:
1. Scope of Work:
   Our client wants to install multiple 30’000 L biomass fermenters to produce microalgae-based products. The required net space for each fermenter is approximately 50m² with a minimum ceiling height of 14 meters. The immediate requirement is for the installation of one bioreactor to commence production. However, the project has the potential to grow, with up to eight fermenters being installed over the next 2-3 years.
2. Downstream Processes:
   In addition to the biomass fermenters, the production facility would require downstream equipment such as a centrifuge, grinder, drum dryer/spray dryer, heating systems, and ultrafiltration units.
3. Project Timeline:
   The first production batch is expected in Q3/Q4 2024.
4. Regulatory Considerations:
   It's important to note that the final product will be shipped to the US, so the production must meet FDA approval standards. No other certifications are required.
5. Raw Materials:
   Our client will provide the initial batch of microalgae. 
We are reaching out to explore whether your company has the capacity and interest to take on this exciting project. If you find this opportunity aligning with your capabilities, we would greatly appreciate the opportunity to discuss further details, including production capabilities, technical specifications, and potential collaboration terms.
Please feel free to contact us with any questions, inquiries, or additional information. We highly value your feedback and look forward to the possibility of working together on this innovative venture.

Roberta";;CH;roberta@agilery.ch;;;
